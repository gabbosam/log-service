#log-service

ASS-POC (Another stupid service for POC)
## Develop

To get started developing the service:

- install dependencies with `npm install` (equivalently `yarn`)

Then you can either:

- `npm run compile` compile code in src folder
- `npm run precommit` some cleaning task then compile, to run before commit and ush
- `npm start` start the application
- `npm run clean` clean the app

## Run

To run the service, simply run `npm start` (`yarn start`).
